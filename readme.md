## But really, what is this repo?

For a long time I've been looking for a place to keep the things I have learned 
throughout my career and in my life. I have tried various personal Wikies, 
company Wikies, notebooks, etc, but I always felt that they were lacking the 
simplicity of a simple markdown file. Then one day, I decided to just put everything 
on GitHub. What, were you expecting some kind of an epic story?
