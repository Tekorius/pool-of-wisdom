# Servers / DevOps Stuff

I am not much of a DevOps guy, I don't like trying to revive a crashed 
MySQL server at 3 am or fending off Chinese bots for a whole week. 
With that said, I still have keep my systems running in sparkling condition.

This will mostly be Apache and Linux server related stuff, but some 
other things might slip in.

I will post my cheatsheets, so I don't have to remember anything.

## Sheets

* [Configuring a new PHP machine](php.md)
* [CSF](csf.md)
* [supervisor.d](supervisord.md)
