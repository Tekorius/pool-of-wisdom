# Useful Linux apps

After installing and configuring your sexy Linux, you need to load it full of 
extremely nice apps. Here's a list along with descriptions and tutorials and whatnot.

* [gmrun](#gmrun) - windows-like run dialog

## Apps

### gmrun

Probably the only good thing about Windows is it's nice `Win+R` shortcut to open up a 
run dialog. I missed that in Ubuntu, so I found a solution - gmrun.

```
sudo apt install gmrun
```

Now don't forget to go to `System Settings > Keyboard Settings > Shortcuts > Custom` 
and set `Win+R` to run `gmrun`
